I love you!


Here are some runs I did:
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
activities <- read.csv("~/Documents/Activities.csv")
cols_to_keep <- c("Distance", "Calories", "Time", "Avg.Run.Cadence", "Avg.Pace", "Moving.Time") # "Date"
activities <- activities[cols_to_keep]
activities
```
